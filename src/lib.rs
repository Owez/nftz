/// Light prelude layer which provides direct imports
///
/// # When to use
///
/// This prelude module is here for simplicity in some developer's workflows,
/// but generally it's best to just import data items from this library directly
/// due to the low amount contained within. In the end, it's up to developer
/// tastes. ‚ù§Ô∏è
///
/// # Example
///
/// This gives access to in times simpler usage of this crate, for example:
///
/// ```rust
/// use onft::prelude::*
///
/// fn main() {
///     let block = Block::default().unwrap();
///     println!("Block:\n{:?}", block);
/// }
/// ```
